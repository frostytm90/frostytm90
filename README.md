I believe in the need to be precise and methodical when it comes to solving issues holistically. I enjoy using a methodical approach to identify root cause, formulate hypotheses, and experiment with different ways to resolve issues. Time and time again, this approach has helped me to resolve and prevent recurring issues.

## Objective

My first exposure to cybersecurity was the need to use Wireshark in my previous role as a QA Engineer. That initial exposure led me to gain a better understanding of the field and led me to be aware of my natural interest in cybersecurity news and tasks. I found myself enjoying Hack The Box and the 6-months vocational training programme that I embarked on to deepen my skillset. My journey in QA has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
